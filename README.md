    <h1>HR Analytics Dashboard</h1>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this project is to help an organization improve employee performance and retention by reducing attrition. The project aims to identify key factors affecting employee attrition through an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Scope</h2>
    <p>
        The focus of the dashboard is on identifying and analyzing the key factors affecting employee attrition. By visualizing data, we aim to provide actionable insights to enhance employee retention strategies, improve hiring processes, and elevate overall employee experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Setup and Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Import:</strong> The data was loaded in Power BI from a CSV file.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Duplicates, null values, and spelling mistakes were handled during the data cleaning process. The dataset was checked for errors and duplicates using Power BI’s data transformation tools.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Processing:</strong> Columns irrelevant to the analysis were removed, and data types were correctly set using Power BI’s data transformation tools.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>KPI Creation and Report Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>KPIs Created:</strong> Attrition Rate, Average Age, Average Salary, Average Years at Company.
        </li>
        <li>
            Attrition rate was calculated using a custom measure: <code>(Total Attrition / Total Employees)</code> and formatted as a percentage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cards were used to display key metrics such as attrition rate, average age, average salary, and average working years.
        </li>
        <li>
            A Donut Chart was used to visualize attrition across different education fields.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stacked Bar Charts, Line Charts, Matrix Tables, and Treemaps were used to visualize data such as salary ranges, job roles, years at company, and gender-wise attrition.
        </li>
        <li>
            Filters and slicers were applied for interactive analysis based on job roles, departments, and more.
        </li>
    </ul>
