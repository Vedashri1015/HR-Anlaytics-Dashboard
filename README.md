        <li>Transforming and cleaning data to remove duplicates and null values.</li>
        <li>Checking data types for consistency.</li>
        <li>Creating pivot tables in Excel to understand data better before importing to Power BI.</li>
    </ol>

 <h2>Power BI Report Creation</h2>
    <p>
        The report includes various visualizations such as:
    </p>
